# R Setup Instructions

Welcome! We look forward to seeing you at the CTM workshop. Before arrival, please have a computer with the following programs installed and set up:

* R 3.1 and Rtools
* Rstudio v0.98.9
* Required R packages

Note: for those of you that already have R installations on your computer, please make sure you have at least R version 3.0.2 and Rstudio version 0.98.9. If you are unsure, upon opening Rstudio, the R version is printed in the console. For the rstudio version, open Rstudio and go to `Help` --> `About Rstudio`


### R 3.1 download 

R can be found on [http://cran.rstudio.com/](http://cran.rstudio.com/)

![Rdownload](images/Rdownload)

2) *download and install* Rtools

![RforWindows](images/RforWindows)

### Rstudio

Rstudio is a fantastic development environment for R that can be used locally and on servers. 

It can be found at [http://www.rstudio.com](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desk)

1) **download and install** Rstudio Desktop (open source edition)

### R package installation

After R, Rtools, and Rstudio are installed, the following packages should be installed:

* ggplot2
* reshape2
* dplyr
* devtools

These can be installed in the console via the command line
```
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "reshape2", "dplyr", "devtools"))
```

or via Rstudio's graphical package installer. A brief video tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1r5XTqrCTQ).


# Optional: Getting Started 

Though no prior experience with R is required, it is suggested to have some familiarity with basic usage. The [datacamp introduction to R course material](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r) can be covered in 1-2 hours, and is *highly* recommended.
