Start by reading in the richPK dataset or loading it from `PKPDdatasets` (sd_oral_richpk)

Using dplyr 'verbs' and `%>%` to chain commands together

1) create a new 'demographic' dataset by subsetting out only one observation per id 
  * `hint: !duplicated`
2) give basic data summary for all individuals using `summary`
3) summarize the demographic dataset by:
 * mean WT by gender
 * range of ages by RACE
4) Using the original dataset add a cmax column

5) Add a HIGHCMAX column that flags all individuals over the 90th percentile
6) create an ISASIAN with a numeric (1/0) flag
