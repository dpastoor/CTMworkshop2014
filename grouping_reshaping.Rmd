## Reshaping Data

There is an excellent package (library) called reshape2

Let's load it and get some data to play with
```{r}
library(reshape2)
keepcols <- c("ID", "TIME", "CONC")
concTime <- data[data$CID < 10, keepcols]
tail(concTime)
```


How can we make a table of concentrations by time for all ID's? (long to wide conversion)

---
```{r}
molten <- melt(concTime, id.vars = c("TIME", "ID"), measure.vars = c("CONC"))
head(molten)
concTimeWide <- dcast(molten, TIME + variable ~ ID)
head(concTimeWide, n = 4)
```
